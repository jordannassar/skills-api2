Cannot register through postman since you have to include a File for the avatar and req.body containing the form input at the same time. Tested both seperately and they work. If you wish to test it, hardcode the req.body values and send formData png/jpeg/jpg file through postman with the field name 'File' . Will have to run ur own psql server since the client im using to host it is local and for mac only.
